Microsoft Remote Desktop is likely already included in your Windows operating system. To verify, type `mstsc` at a Command Prompt window. If it's not already included, you can obtain it through the Microsoft Store.

To install the client from the Microsoft Store, you need to login with your Microsoft Account. If you have trouble accessing the  Microsoft Store, you can consider the Remote Desktop Manager as a free alternative.
