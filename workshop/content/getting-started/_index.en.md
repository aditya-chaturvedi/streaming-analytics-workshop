To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

* ...[attending an AWS hosted event (using AWS provided hashes)]({{< relref "./aws-event/" >}})
* ...[running the workshop on your own (in your own account)]({{< relref "./self-paced/" >}})

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with [**Configure development environment**]({{< relref "/configure" >}})
