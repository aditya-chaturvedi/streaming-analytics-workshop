Unless you have already an RDP client available on your laptop, you need to install one now so that you can connect to the Windows instance that has been provisioned for you. Follow the specific instructions for your operating system to install an RDP client, preferably Microsoft Remote Desktop 10.

Once you have a working RDP client available on your laptop, you can proceed to the next step to retrieve the Windows password and to log into the Windows instance.
