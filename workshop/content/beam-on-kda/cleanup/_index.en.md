This chapter is to delete the resources after completing the workshop.

1. If running a hosted AWS workshop the resources and account will be available for the rest of the day to allow you to continue the worksop in your own time.

1. If you are running in your own account plase goto to the Amazon CloudFormation dasboard and delete the **beam-workshop stack** that you created. This will remove the resources to prevent incurring any costs.
